          <p>3.1 In this Section 3 we have set out:</p>
          <p>
            (a) the general categories of personal data that we may process;
          </p>
          <p>(b) the purposes for which we may process personal data; and</p>
          <p>(c) the legal bases of the processing.</p>
          <p>

            perform calculations and display the results to you. None of the
            information you enter is stored on the server longer than is
            necessary to perform the calculations and cannot be accessed by the
            owners of the website or any third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3 We may process data about your use of our website and services
            ("usage data"). The usage data may include your IP address,
            geographical location, browser type and version, operating system,
            referral source, length of visit, page views and website navigation
            paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and
            pattern of your service use. The source of the usage data is Google
            Analytics. This usage data may be processed for the purposes of
            analysing the use of the website and services. The legal basis for
            this processing is our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and
            improving our website and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4 We may process information that you post for publication on our
            website or through our services ("publication data"). The
            publication data may be processed for the purposes of enabling such
            publication and administering our website and services. The legal
            basis for this processing is consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.5 We may process information contained in or relating to any
            communication that you send to us ("correspondence data"). The
            correspondence data may include the communication content and
            metadata associated with the communication. The correspondence data
            may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and
            record-keeping. The legal basis for this processing is our
            legitimate interests, namely the proper administration of our
            website and business and communications with users.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.6 We may process any of your personal data identified in this
            policy where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of
            legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
            or out-of-court procedure. The legal basis for this processing is
            our legitimate interests, namely the protection and assertion of our
            legal rights, your legal rights and the legal rights of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.7 We may process any of your personal data identified in this
            policy where necessary for the purposes of obtaining or maintaining
            insurance coverage, managing risks, or obtaining professional
            advice. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate
            interests, namely the proper protection of our business against
            risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.8 In addition to the specific purposes for which we may process
            your personal data set out in this Section 3, we may also process
            any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in
            order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of
            another natural person.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.9 Please do not supply any other person's personal data to us,
            unless we prompt you to do so.

          </h3>
          <p>
            4.1 We may disclose your personal data to our insurers and/or
            professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for the
            purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing
            risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise
            or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an
            administrative or out-of-court procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out
            in this Section 4, we may disclose your personal data where such
            disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or
            the vital interests of another natural person. We may also disclose
            your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court
            proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.

            5.1 In this Section 5, we provide information about the
            circumstances in which your personal data may be transferred to
            countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

            6. Retaining and deleting personal data
          </h3>
          <p>
            6.1 This Section 6 sets out our data retention policies and
            procedure, which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our
            legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of
            personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall
            not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>6.3 We will retain your personal data as follows:</p>
          <p>
            (a) Usage data will be retained for a maximum period of 26 months
            following your last visit to the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.4 In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance
            the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such
            cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the
            following criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) the period of retention of publication data will be determined
            based on historical relevance and continuity of presentation of
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) the period of retention of correspondance data will be
            determined based on record-keeping requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.5 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may
            retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in
            order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of
            another natural person.

          <h3 class="font-bold mt-3">7. Amendments</h3>
          <p>
            7.1 We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new
            version on our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.2 You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy
            with any changes to this policy.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-bold mt-3">8. Your rights</h3>
          <p>
            8.1 In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have
            under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not
            all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly,
            you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory
            authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
          </p>
          <p>8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p>
          <p>(a) the right to access;</p>
          <p>(b) the right to rectification;</p>
          <p>(c) the right to erasure;</p>
          <p>(d) the right to restrict processing;</p>
          <p>(e) the right to object to processing;</p>
          <p>(f) the right to data portability;</p>
          <p>(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</p>
          <p>(h) the right to withdraw consent.</p>
          <p>
            8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we
            process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal
            data, together with certain additional information. That additional
            information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the
            categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the
            personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not
            affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
            first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies
            may be subject to a reasonable fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about
            you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the
            processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
            completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
            personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the
            personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes
            for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw
            consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing
            under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
            processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data
            have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the
            right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is
            necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
            information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
            processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you
            contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful
            but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the
            purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have
            objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.
            Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue
            to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process
            it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of
            legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
            legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
            data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to
            the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
            processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out
            in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority
            vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
            us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease
            to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate
            compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
            interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
            data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
            purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless
            the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
            out for reasons of public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
            personal data is:
          </p>
          <p>(a) consent; or</p>
          <p>
            (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your
            request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is
            carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your
            personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
            machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it
            would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal
            information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right
            to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for
            data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your
            habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
            infringement.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
            personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that
            consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
            processing before the withdrawal.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your
            personal data by written notice to us in addition to the other
            methods specified in this Section 8.
